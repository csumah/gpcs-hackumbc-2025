## How to play 
1. Click Start on the title screen to open the game.
2. Each quarter you receive income and may choose to invest some of your cash into either ETF (HIT) or STAND to do nothing.
3. After you make your choice the quarter resolves, investments grow/decline according to the market event, and inflation affects cash.
4. At the end of each year a recap modal summarizes performance for the year. At the end of the scenario you get a final chart comparing your results vs saving only.
